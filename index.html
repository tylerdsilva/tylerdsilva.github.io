<p id= 'paragraph'>I am a 1A Systems Design Engineer at the University of Waterloo.  I love to apply my problem solving and critical thinking skills to new experiences.  I am willing to learn new things that are interesting and that help make an impact.  In the future, I hope to continue a career in software development and apply my knowledge to making new ideas and experiences a reality.  Currently, I am looking for an intership to learn and apply knowledge and gain practical experience in development.<br> In my spare time, I like to learn new languages and trying to design new projects to help increase my exoerience.  For extracurricular, I am very passionate and competitive about tennis, and love playing the clarinet.
